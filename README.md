## 🧪 Learning Philosophy

This repo follows a **learn → implement → experiment → optimize** pipeline.

Every notebook reflects:

* A concept learned
* A model built
* A failure analyzed
* Or an insight discovered
---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (So Far)

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* NLTK

---

## 📜 License

This repository is open for learning and experimentation.
Reuse ideas, but build your own intelligence.
